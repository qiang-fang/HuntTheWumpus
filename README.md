## Introduction to the game

Hunt the Wumpus is a text-based adventure game (Links to an external site.) where a player navigates through a series of caves hunting a monster called the Wumpus. You can read more about it in the author's Hunt the Wumpus (Links to an external site.) description. The game consists of a maze of caves connected by tunnels where several of the caves contain obstacles in the form of bottomless pits and superbats, as well as the Wumpus who is hiding out in one of the caves ready to eat the player.

A player that encounters a bottomless pit falls to their death. A player that encounters a superbat has a chance of being whisked away and dropped in some other random cave in the maze. A player that encounters the Wumpus is eaten. To win the game, a player can shoot a crooked arrow into a neighboring cave. If the arrow encounters the Wumpus, it kills the monster and the player wins the game. The player has only a limited number of arrows in their quiver; if they shoot the arrow into a cave with no Wumpus, the arrow is lost. If the player runs out of arrows, they lose the game.

A player cannot see into adjacent caves. However, to help them navigate the world, they can see tunnels moving into the darkness. In addition, when a player enters a cave, they can smell if the Wumpus is nearby (namely, in an adjacent cave) or feel a draft from a nearby pit. There is no warning for the superbats.
